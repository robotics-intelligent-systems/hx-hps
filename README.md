# Hybrid Propulsion System

Saab Aeronautics has chosen Modelica and Dymola as part of the means for modelo based system engineering (MBSE). The Boeing X-48 is an american experimental unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) built to investigate the characteristics of blended wing body (BWB) aircraft. A modular and flexible hydrogen transport aircraft concept involves designing aircraft with interchangeable parts and adaptable propulsion systems, such as hydrogen fuel cells and electric motors, to optimize efficiency and reduce costs. The Advanced Geared Turbofan 30,000 lbf Electrified (AGTF30-e) is an electrified geared turbofan that leverages the previously developed AGTF30 model. T-MATS is a Simulink toolbox designed for use in modeling and simulating thermodynamic systems and their controls. OpenVSP is a parametric aircraft geometry tool. RCE is an open-source, distributed, workflow-based integration environment. Engineers and scientists use it to design and simulate complex systems (e.g., aircraft, ships, or satellites) by integrating their own design and simulation tools. Scilab is a software for numerical analysis, with a high-level programming language for scientific computation. Chrono is an open-source multi-physics simulation framework used to investigate fluid-solid interaction problems and the dynamics of large systems of rigid and/or flexible bodies. Panda3D is an open-source, completely free-to-use engine for realtime 3D games, visualizations, simulations, experiments. Apache Ditto is a software framework for digital twins, a virtual representation of devices in the real world. Odoo's MRP module covers all aspects of manufacturing, including material planning, production scheduling, and quality controlâ€”crucial aspects for aerospace manufacturing. GraalPy provides a runtime environment compatible with Python 3.11. Augusta is simple, low-level, systems programming language based on Ada.
